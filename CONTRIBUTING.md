Contributions of any kind are welcome.
Some examples of contributions possible:

* Creating new resume styles by adding custom CSS in **pelican_resume/static/css**
* Modifying the plugin code itself to add new options/parameters.

To contribute, you can fork the repository and send me a pull request (on master is fine).
